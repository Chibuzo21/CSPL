    intro: `Kingdom-Driven Business is a biblically grounded exploration of how Christian faith is meant to inform, govern, and transform business practice in the modern marketplace. Rejecting the false dichotomy between the sacred and the secular, the book argues that business is not merely an economic activity but a divine stewardship entrusted to believers for the advancement of God’s purposes on earth.

Drawing from Scripture, theology, and real-world business principles, the author presents a coherent framework for understanding wealth creation, leadership, and enterprise as expressions of Kingdom responsibility. From Genesis to the teachings of Christ and the apostolic church, the book demonstrates that God has always been concerned with how resources are generated, managed, and distributed - and that prosperity, when rightly ordered, is meant to serve people, glorify God, and advance justice.

The book addresses critical questions facing Christian entrepreneurs, professionals, and leaders today:
Can profit and righteousness coexist?
What distinguishes Kingdom success from worldly success?
How should Christians navigate competition, power, and wealth without compromising faith?

Through careful exposition, the author challenges prosperity extremes on both sides - rejecting materialism that idolizes wealth, as well as spiritualized poverty that denies God’s provision. Instead, Kingdom-Driven Business presents a balanced theology of stewardship rooted in obedience, integrity, accountability, and service.
Central themes include ethical leadership, servant authority, diligence, innovation, generosity, and purpose-driven enterprise. Readers are guided to see business as a calling, leadership as a trust, and wealth as a tool rather than an end. The book emphasizes that Kingdom-driven leaders are not merely profit-oriented but impact-focused - concerned with people, systems, communities, and legacy.

Importantly, the book speaks directly to the realities of today’s marketplace: global competition, ethical compromise, corruption, pressure for quick gains, and the marginalization of faith in professional spaces. Against this backdrop, it offers a compelling vision of Christians who operate with excellence while remaining uncompromising in character and conviction.
Written in a clear, instructive, and pastoral tone, Kingdom-Driven Business serves as both a theological guide and a practical manifesto for believers who desire to honor God through their work. It calls readers to reimagine success, align enterprise with eternal values, and participate intentionally in God’s redemptive agenda through business.

Ultimately, the book affirms that when business is surrendered to Christ’s lordship, it becomes a powerful instrument for transformation - shaping lives, influencing culture, and extending the Kingdom of God in tangible ways.`,

    intro: `SINS OF THE FATHERS is a biblical and doctrinal examination of the popular teaching that ancestral sins and generational curses continue to affect born-again Christians. Drawing extensively from both Old and New Testament Scriptures, the book challenges the assumption that salvation in Christ requires supplementary deliverance from ancestral liabilities.

Beginning with the historical and scriptural origins of generational judgment under the Old Covenant, the author carefully demonstrates that even within the Old Testament, God progressively moved toward individual accountability. Passages from Ezekiel, Jeremiah, and Isaiah clearly establish that each soul bears responsibility for its own sin, not that of its ancestors.

The book then transitions into the New Covenant, where the finished work of Christ becomes the central focus. Through detailed exposition of Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Hebrews, and Peter’s epistles, the author shows that Christ’s Blood provides total redemption - cleansing not only for personal sins but also every legal claim arising from the past.

The work also addresses contemporary practices such as land deliverance, ancestral cleansing rituals, and fear-based deliverance ministries, exposing their lack of New Testament foundation. It emphasizes that spiritual transformation comes through repentance, faith, and regeneration - not rituals applied to geography or genealogy.

Ultimately, SINS OF THE FATHERS calls believers back to confidence in Christ, sound doctrine, and the supremacy of Scripture. It affirms that salvation is complete, freedom is real, and the believer’s inheritance in Christ is secure and untouchable."`,

    intro: `Joseph: A Story of Faith and Forgiveness is a compelling retelling of the biblical account of Joseph, presented in a warm, reflective, and accessible narrative that highlights God’s sovereign plan, the cost of jealousy, and the redemptive power of forgiveness. The book follows Joseph from his early years as a favored son and gifted dreamer through betrayal, suffering, and eventual restoration, revealing how faith sustained him through life’s darkest moments.

Joseph’s journey begins in his father Jacob’s household, where favoritism and prophetic dreams spark intense sibling rivalry. His brothers’ jealousy culminates in betrayal, as Joseph is sold into slavery and taken far from home to Egypt. Despite the injustice he faces - false accusations, imprisonment, and isolation - Joseph remains steadfast in his trust in God. Even in confinement, his God-given ability to interpret dreams becomes a channel through which divine purpose continues to unfold.

Through a remarkable turn of events, Joseph rises from prison to a position of great authority in Egypt, becoming instrumental in preserving nations during a devastating famine. When his brothers unknowingly come to him in search of food, Joseph faces the ultimate test: whether to avenge the wrongs done to him or to extend mercy. Choosing forgiveness, Joseph reveals himself, reconciles with his brothers, and acknowledges God’s hand in transforming evil intentions into good.

Written especially with young readers in mind but meaningful for all ages, the book emphasizes enduring values such as resilience, humility, trust in God’s timing, and the healing power of forgiveness. Joseph: A Story of Faith and Forgiveness is not merely a historical retelling; it is a timeless guide that encourages readers to see their own struggles through the lens of divine purpose and to embrace forgiveness as a pathway to peace, restoration, and abundance.`,

    intro: `The Legacy of Ancestry by Chibueze Ukaegbu is a thorough biblical and pastoral rebuttal to the widespread teaching on "ancestral curses" or "generational sins." The book argues that this belief - which holds believers spiritually bound by the sins and failures of their forebears - is a debilitating myth that contradicts the core message of the Gospel.

Ukaegbu begins by acknowledging the real psychological and behavioral patterns that can echo through families, but he sharply distinguishes these from a state of spiritual condemnation or inescapable divine punishment. He carefully examines key Old Testament passages often cited to support generational curses (like Exodus 20:5), placing them in their full covenantal and historical context to show they describe the natural consequences of sin in a fallen world, not an immutable spiritual law.

The book's central theme is that the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ fundamentally rewrote the rules of spiritual inheritance. Through Christ’s redemptive work on the cross, believers are utterly transformed: they become new creations (2 Corinthians 5:17), adopted into God’s family, and are freed from every curse of the law (Galatians 3:13). The author powerfully asserts that a believer’s primary identity is no longer in their biological lineage but in their spiritual lineage in Christ.

Structured over ten chapters, the journey moves from "The Shadows of Our Forebears" through scriptural analysis in "The Genesis of Sin" to the pivotal "Graceful Interruption" of the New Covenant. Practical sections guide readers to break free from fear ("The Illusion of the Chain"), embrace a new identity, engage in transformative worship ("The Symphony of Grace"), and symbolically release past burdens ("Burning the Records of Fear"). The final chapters focus on living in victory and sharing a new legacy of hope.

Ultimately, this book is a call to shift from a fear-based digging up of the past to a faith-based embracing of our future in Christ. It assures believers that they are defined not by their ancestry but by their redemption, empowering them to live in freedom and pass on a legacy of grace to their future generations.`,

    intro: `The Deity of the Lord Jesus Christ: A Biblical Examination is a doctrinal and devotional exploration demonstrating through Scripture that Jesus Christ is truly and eternally God. Its central aim is to answer Jesus’ question, “But whom say ye that I am?” by showing from Genesis to Revelation that the Man of Nazareth is the Almighty God incarnate .

The book begins by presenting God’s eternal nature - His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence, and connects these attributes directly to Christ, who declares Himself the “I AM” and “the Word” who existed before creation . Using Old Testament prophecies (Isaiah 9, Micah 5, Psalms), the author shows that the Messiah was foretold as both divine King and suffering Servant. These prophetic threads converge in the New Testament where Jesus forgives sins, receives worship, claims unity with the Father, and is identified as the perfect image of the invisible God (John 10:30; Col. 2:9) .

A major section explores Jesus as the eternal Word (Logos) through John 1:1–5, showing Him as Creator, Life-giver, and Light of humanity. His pre-existence, involvement in creation, and sustaining power affirm His full deity. Christ’s identity as “Alpha and Omega” is emphasized to demonstrate His rule over all time, history, and destiny.

The book then moves into John’s vision of the glorified Christ in Revelation 1. Jesus appears in overwhelming majesty - radiant, eternal, authoritative, and glorified. His white hair, flaming eyes, bronze feet, and thunderous voice convey divine wisdom, judgment, purity, and power. This heavenly revelation invites believers into deeper reverence and transforms their understanding of worship, as the saints and angels proclaim Him worthy of all honor and glory.

The later chapters apply these truths to the believer’s life, stressing that recognizing Christ’s deity is not mere doctrine but the foundation of salvation, worship, transformation, and eternal hope. Christ is not distant - He entered history, bore human suffering, and conquered death so humanity could receive abundant and eternal life.

The book concludes with an invitation: having seen Christ revealed through Scripture as Lord and God, every reader must answer personally who Jesus is. Those who believe receive eternal life; those who already believe are called to deeper worship, boldness, and devotion. The final message declares Christ as the eternal King who secures believers’ destiny and will reign forever .`,

    intro: `The Bridge That Love Built is a deeply reflective, spiritually rich exploration of humanity’s separation from God and the divine love that reaches across the chasm. Through vivid imagery, biblical insight, and theological clarity, the book traces the human story from the painful reality of the Fall to the hope-filled promise of redemption in Christ.
The author presents the human condition as a landscape marked by longing - an inner ache that reveals our distance from God. Sin is portrayed not merely as disobedience, but as a quiet rebellion that creates an internal storm: pride, confusion, spiritual dryness, and brokenness. These fractures, symbolized by torn threads and desert storms, expose the futility of our attempts to reconcile with God through human effort, morality, rituals, and self-reliance.
As the narrative unfolds, it becomes clear that humanity’s DIY bridges inevitably collapse under the weight of imperfection. Yet, the book does not leave the reader in despair. Instead, it reveals the heart of God - the Divine Architect - who lovingly constructed a perfect, unbreakable Bridge in Jesus Christ. Through His incarnation, sacrificial death, and triumphant resurrection, Christ spans the divide, offering reconciliation, grace, and eternal connection to all who will come.
Each chapter invites the reader into a journey from separation to restoration, from shadows to light. It highlights God’s relentless pursuit of humanity, the futility of self-made solutions, and the transforming power of grace. The book culminates in a heartfelt invitation: to step onto the Bridge by faith, embrace the love that transcends every barrier, and enter into the wholeness for which we were created.
Richly devotional and theologically profound, The Bridge That Love Built guides readers toward spiritual awakening, renewed hope, and a deeper understanding of God’s redemptive plan. It is a call to cease striving, surrender to divine love, and walk confidently into restored fellowship with the One who bridged the gap with His own life.`,

    intro: `From Pain to Plenty: Finding Abundance through Forgiveness is a faith-centered exploration of how unforgiveness imprisons the human heart and how forgiveness, grounded in biblical truth, releases believers into a life of peace, healing, and spiritual abundance. Drawing deeply from Scripture, theology, and lived human experience, the book confronts the hidden wounds many carry - betrayal, loss, injustice, and disappointment - and exposes the silent damage caused by bitterness and resentment.

The book begins by helping readers acknowledge unresolved pain and recognize how suppressed wounds shape emotions, relationships, and spiritual vitality. It examines the emotional, physical, and spiritual weight of unforgiveness, integrating biblical warnings with psychological insights that reveal how bitterness corrodes inner well-being. Through Scripture, readers are guided to understand forgiveness not as denial, weakness, or forced reconciliation, but as a courageous, liberating act of obedience and trust in God.

Central to the book is Christ Himself - the ultimate model of forgiveness - whose life, teachings, and sacrifice reveal forgiveness as the pathway to freedom and abundance. Biblical narratives, including those of Joseph, David, Job, and others, illustrate how God transforms pain into purpose when hearts choose mercy over retaliation. The book also addresses difficult realities, such as forgiving without reconciliation, setting healthy boundaries, and overcoming internal resistance to forgiveness.

Practical guidance is woven throughout, offering readers tools such as prayer, reflection, journaling, and spiritual discipline to support the forgiveness journey. Rather than presenting forgiveness as a one-time event, the book emphasizes it as a process - sometimes gradual, often challenging, but always transformative.

Ultimately, From Pain to Plenty invites readers into a deeper understanding of abundance - not as material prosperity, but as spiritual wholeness marked by peace, joy, restored identity, and intimacy with God. It affirms that forgiveness is the bridge between suffering and freedom, and that no pain surrendered to God is ever wasted.

    intro: `The effects of the penetration of cultures and traditions of men in the Church are vividly seen in the interpersonal relationships of the saints. Generational norms and beliefs anchored on mindset, culture and traditions of men have made our relationship with one another placid, hypocritical and, in most cases, non-existent as a result of race, tribe, color of skin, country of origin or status.

The Lord Jesus Christ paid with His life in order to bring to birth His brothers and sisters. How then can we be comfortable treating the brothers and sisters of our Lord Jesus Christ in a very derogatory way because of their personal appearance rather than as a result of the Christ in them?

The CORE of this book is intended to bring to the notice of God’s Children that WE ARE FAMILY irrespective of our color of skin, race etc. The book goes on to further show that:

1. The Family of God is not I SENSITIVE, BUT THE LORDSHIP OF CHRIST SENSITIVE
2. The Family of God is not RACE SENSITIVE, BUT CHRIST SENSITIVE
3. The Family of God is not STATUS SENSITIVE, BUT LIFE OF GOD SENSITIVE
4. The Family of God is not COLOR SENSITIVE, BUT SPIRIT SENSITIVE

The bottom line is that we shall continue to wallow in our insensitivity until we truly submit to the LORDSHIP OF JESUS CHRIST.`,
